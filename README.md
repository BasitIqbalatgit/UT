# University-Time-Table
Introduction:
As we know, one of the major challenges faced by universities is creating a time table that meets the needs of both students and faculty. The current system of manual time table generation is time-consuming, error-prone, and often results in scheduling conflicts that are difficult to resolve.
The proposed system will be a desktop application that automates the time table generation process. The system will take into consideration the constraints and requirements of both students and faculty, such as slots, professor availability, room availability. The system will also be customizable, allowing for the inclusion of specific course preferences and restrictions.
The benefits of this proposed system are numerous. Firstly, it will eliminate the need for manual time table generation, reducing the potential for errors and inconsistencies. Secondly, it will increase the efficiency of the time table generation process, freeing up valuable time for administrators to focus on other important tasks. Lastly, it will improve the student experience by providing them with a time table that is tailored to their specific needs, ensuring that they have access to the classes they need at times that are convenient for them.
